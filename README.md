## VeinVision_1

VeinVision_1 is a Python-based project that utilizes OpenCV to detect and visualize veins in hand images. It offers both static image processing and live video capture modes, providing flexibility for various use cases.

## ðŸ–¼ Static Image Processing

The static.py script processes a single input image (static_input.png) to detect veins and saves the output as static_output.png. This mode is suitable for testing and demonstrations without requiring a camera.


 Usage

Place your input image in the repository directory and rename it to static_input.png.

Run the script:

python static.py


The output will be saved as static_output.png.


## ðŸŽ¥ Live Video Capture

The live.py script captures live video from a webcam or IP camera, processes each frame to detect veins, and displays the original and processed images side by side. It also allows manual capture of images during the live session.

 Features

Manual Capture: Press s to save the current frame and its processed version.

Auto Capture: Press 1 to start auto-capturing frames for 20 seconds.

Quit: Press q to exit the live capture.

## Requirements

Python 3.x

OpenCV (opencv-python)


## Usage

Ensure your camera is connected and accessible.

Run the script:

python live.py


Follow the on-screen instructions for capturing images.

Captured images will be saved in the captures/ folder.


## ðŸ“· Example Output
Static Processing

![outputs.png] 

Live Capture

During live capture, the left side of the window displays the processed image (veins highlighted), and the right side shows the original frame.

![static_output.png] 


ðŸ“Œ Notes

The captures/ folder is created automatically during live capture to store images.

Ensure that your camera is properly configured and accessible by OpenCV for live capture functionality.
